# ML-PROJECTS - HOTEL OCCUPANCY PREDICTION


<h2> Hotels in the modern form emerged a long time ago. In 1794 the first hotel (City Hotel) was constructed in New York City and it contained 73 rooms. <br><br>
In 1829, Tremont Hotel, the largest and most luxurious hotel in the world, was also created in the United States in Boston, where hotel specialists at that time considered that the interior design, 
building design and the equipments of a hotel the evolution of a the modern hotel industry in America and spread out to the rest of the world.<br><br>
Ever since, hotels have begun growing and constantly changing from all aspects and in a gradual form.<br><br>
Professional theoretical references suggest that hotels are considered one of the key elements that underpin tourism Industry and the transport of all forms, as well as other activities.<br><br>
Not making a full use of the hotel’s absorptive capacity results in the depletion of that hotel’s profit, since ideal
profitability rate is reached when the "occupancy rates" is equal to the hotel’s absorptive capacity. <br><br>
The main problem for the hotels managements is the lack of knowledge of the key factors that control the occupancy rates. </h2>

# Approach:

To address these problems, We will be using Regression algorithms such as Linear Regression,Decision tree, Random
forest, AdaBoost, GradientBoost and XGBoost. We will train and test the data with these algorithms. 
From this the best model is selected and saved in pkl format. We will also be deploying our model locally using Flask.
